>Welcome to my collection of CTF (Capture The Flag) writeups!  

>This repository includes solutions, notes, and explanations for various challenges I've solved on platforms like [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), and [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/).

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific CTF room or challenge and contains:
- A detailed writeup (usually in `README.md` or a Markdown file)
- Scripts or exploits used
- Any other relevant files (like payloads, binaries, etc.)

## 📝 Writeups

Here are some of the rooms/challenges I've worked on:

- 🔐 `Hack The Box`  
- 🌐 `TryHackMe`
- 🧮 `PicoCTF`


## 🛠 Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Nmap, Gobuster, Burp Suite
- Python, Bash scripts
- Ghidra, GDB, pwndbg (for RE & pwn)
- Custom tooling as needed

## 🧠 Notes

I keep personal notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and some of them are cleaned up and shared here as writeups for learning and reference.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
