# 🛡️ Wi-Fi Hacking: Techniques, Tools, and Ethical Considerations

> **Disclaimer:** This document is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical. Always conduct penetration testing with **explicit permission**.

## 🔍 Introduction

Wireless networks are a vital component of modern communication, offering convenience but also introducing significant security risks. As a cybersecurity student, understanding Wi-Fi vulnerabilities and attack techniques is crucial to building defensive strategies.

## 📡 Overview of Wi-Fi Security Protocols

|Protocol|Security Level|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**WEP**|Very Weak|Easily cracked within minutes|
|**WPA**|Weak|Vulnerable to dictionary attacks|
|**WPA2**|Moderate|Susceptible to KRACK, handshake attacks|
|**WPA3**|Strong|More secure but still being adopted|

## 🧰 Common Wi-Fi Hacking Techniques

### 1. **Packet Sniffing**

- **Goal:** Capture unencrypted traffic.
    
- **Tools:** `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`.
    
- **Use Case:** Network analysis, credential harvesting.
    

### 2. **WEP Cracking**

- **Goal:** Exploit weak encryption.
    
- **Tools:** `aircrack-ng`, `kismet`.
    
- **Method:** Capture IVs and use statistical attacks.
    

### 3. **WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture and Cracking**

- **Goal:** Extract Pre-Shared Key (PSK).
    
- **Tools:** `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, `aircrack-ng`, `hashcat`.
    
- **Method:**
    
    1. Capture 4-way handshake.
        
    2. Use a wordlist attack on the hash.
        

### 4. **Deauthentication Attack**

- **Goal:** Disconnect users to force a reconnect (handshake capture).
    
- **Tools:** `aireplay-ng`, `mdk3`, `Bettercap`.
    
- **Risk:** Can be easily detected and mitigated.
    

### 5. **Evil Twin Attack**

- **Goal:** Set up a fake AP to trick users.
    
- **Tools:** `Fluxion`, `hostapd`, `WiFi Pumpkin`.
    
- **Purpose:** Credential harvesting or MITM attacks.
    

### 6. **WPS PIN Attack**

- **Goal:** Exploit insecure WPS feature.
    
- **Tools:** `Reaver`, `bully`.
    
- **Note:** Most modern routers disable WPS or rate-limit attempts.

## ⚖️ Ethical and Legal Considerations

- Only test **networks you own** or have **explicit authorization** to audit.
    
- Unauthorized access is a **criminal offense** under laws like the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**.
    
- Ethical hacking requires **transparency, permission**, and **responsible disclosure**.

## 🛡️ Defensive Strategies

### For Users:

- Use **WPA3** if available.
    
- Set **strong, unique passphrases**.
    
- Turn off **WPS**.
    
- Use **VPNs** on public networks.
    

### For Admins:

- Monitor for rogue APs.
    
- Regularly audit Wi-Fi logs.
    
- Employ **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**.
    
- Train users to avoid suspicious Wi-Fi connections.

## 📘 Conclusion

Understanding Wi-Fi hacking techniques is essential for identifying and mitigating threats in the real world. As cybersecurity professionals, we bear the responsibility to use this knowledge **ethically** and **constructively**.

Stay curious, stay ethical.
