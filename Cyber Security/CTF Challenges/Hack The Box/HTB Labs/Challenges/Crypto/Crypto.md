# HTB Crypto Challenges

Hack The Box (HTB) **Crypto Challenges** are designed to test and enhance your knowledge and skills in cryptography. The challenges explore a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, their vulnerabilities, and techniques to break them. Crypto challenges on HTB can range from simple classical cipher puzzles to complex real-world encryption vulnerabilities.

## Types of Crypto Challenges on HTB

### 1. **Classical Ciphers**
   These challenges focus on traditional cryptographic methods. They are often the starting point for cryptography-related problems and typically involve manual techniques.

   - **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed amount.
   - **Vigenère Cipher**: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.
   - **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters.
   - **Substitution Cipher**: Each letter or group of letters in the plaintext is replaced with another letter or group of letters.

   **Challenges**:
   - Decrypting a message given the key length or some known plaintext.
   - Cracking simple ciphers using frequency analysis or pattern recognition.

### 2. **Symmetric Key Algorithms**
   Symmetric key algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption. HTB challenges often involve exploiting weaknesses or performing attacks on these algorithms.

   - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: The standard symmetric algorithm, used in a wide variety of real-world applications.
   - **RC4**: A stream cipher that encrypts data one byte at a time, used in protocols like SSL/TLS (though insecure now).
   - **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: An older symmetric encryption method, largely obsolete due to its weak key size.
   - **ChaCha20**: A newer and more secure stream cipher that’s commonly used for securing data in applications like VPNs.

   **Challenges**:
   - Breaking AES with weak keys or by exploiting weak encryption modes like ECB (Electronic Codebook).
   - Attacks against stream ciphers like **Keystream Recovery** or **Related Key Attacks**.

### 3. **Asymmetric Key Algorithms**
   Asymmetric algorithms use a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. These challenges involve breaking public-key encryption schemes and signature algorithms.

   - **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: One of the most widely used asymmetric encryption schemes, often the focus of HTB crypto challenges.
   - **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: A modern asymmetric encryption technique that uses elliptic curve mathematics.
   - **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**: Used for digital signatures, verifying the authenticity of messages.

   **Challenges**:
   - Attacks such as **RSA key factorization**, **Low Exponent Attacks**, or **Padding Oracle Attacks**.
   - Exploiting weak implementations, such as using **small public exponents** (e.g., RSA with exponent 3).
   - **Elliptic Curve Attacks** like **Logarithmic Discrete Attacks** or **Side-Channel Attacks**.

---

### 4. **Cryptanalysis**
   Cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptographic systems without access to the secret key. HTB challenges often involve applying cryptanalysis techniques to decipher data or uncover hidden keys.

   **Common Attacks**:
   - **Brute Force**: Trying all possible keys or solutions. This can be slow, but might work on weak systems or small key sizes.
   - **Frequency Analysis**: Used in breaking substitution ciphers by analyzing the frequency of letters in the ciphertext and matching them with common letter distributions in the language.
   - **Known Plaintext Attack**: This attack assumes that part of the plaintext is known, allowing attackers to compute the key used for encryption.
   - **Birthday Paradox**: Used in attacks like finding collisions in hash functions (e.g., **MD5** and **SHA1**).

---

### 5. **Hashing and HMAC**
   Cryptographic hashing functions generate a fixed-size hash value from variable-length input data. Hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) are used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message.

   - **MD5**: An older, now broken hash function.
   - **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**: SHA-256 and other members of the SHA family are commonly used in cryptography.
   - **bcrypt**: A hashing algorithm designed to be slow to make brute-forcing attacks harder.
   - **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**: Uses a cryptographic hash function along with a secret key to verify message integrity.

   **Challenges**:
   - **Rainbow Table Attacks**: Precomputed tables of hash values used for fast lookups to reverse weak hashes.
   - **Collision Attacks**: Finding two different inputs that hash to the same output. Often used against broken hash functions like MD5 and SHA1.
   - **Brute Force or Dictionary Attacks** against poorly implemented hashes (e.g., unsalted passwords).

---

### 6. **Steganography (Crypto-based)**
   Some HTB crypto challenges combine **steganography** (the practice of hiding messages in files) with cryptography. These challenges require you to extract hidden data embedded in files (such as images or audio).

   - **Lsb (Least Significant Bit) Encoding**: Hiding data in the least significant bits of an image or audio file.
   - **Image-Based Steganography**: Using cryptography to hide messages in image files, often requiring the decryption of embedded messages after retrieving them.
   - **Audio Steganography**: Hiding data within audio files using cryptographic methods to protect the hidden message.

## HTB Crypto Challenge Process

### 1. **Download and Unzip the Files**
   The challenge often starts by downloading a zip file that contains the encrypted data or code (e.g., `out.txt`, `source.py`, etc.). The first step is extracting the file.

   ```bash
   unzip Challenge.zip
```

### 2. **Identify Encryption and Cipher**

Once the files are extracted, the first thing is to understand what encryption method has been used. You may encounter encrypted ciphertexts, and it’s important to identify whether it’s a classical cipher, symmetric encryption, or something more complex.

**Command to check file type**:

```bash
file challenge_file
```

### 3. **Cryptanalysis / Brute Force**

Depending on the challenge, you may need to apply cryptanalysis techniques to decrypt the data. For example, if you are given an encrypted message, you might need to:

- Find the key.
    
- Identify the encryption mode (e.g., ECB or CBC for AES).
    
- Use frequency analysis or brute-force methods.
    

**Brute-forcing a cipher**:

```bash
python3 crack_cipher.py
```

### 4. **Decryption and Verification**

Once the key or plaintext is recovered, verify it by decoding it using the appropriate algorithm or tool.

```python
decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message)
print(decrypted_message)
```

### 5. **Flag Extraction**

After decrypting the message or solving the challenge, the flag will often be hidden in the plaintext. Once extracted, it is typically in the format `HTB{}`.
