# 🔍 HTB Labs – Reverse Engineering Challenges

**Reverse Engineering (RE)** challenges on Hack The Box are designed to test your ability to analyze compiled programs (binaries), understand their behavior, and extract useful information—without access to the original source code.

---

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced

- Static analysis (disassembling code)
- Dynamic analysis (debugging)
- Binary patching
- Keygen/crackme solving
- Flag extraction through logic reversal

---

## 🧰 Tools Commonly Used

- Ghidra
- IDA Free / Pro
- Cutter (Radare2 GUI)
- GDB + pwndbg
- Linux CLI tools (`strings`, `ltrace`, `objdump`, `file`, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Challenge Objectives

- Understand and reverse logic
- Bypass checks (e.g., serial validation)
- Retrieve or reconstruct flags
- Identify vulnerabilities in program flow

Example flag:
```

HTB{example_flag_here}

```

## 🚀 Beginner RE Challenges to Try

- Basic Crackme
- Reversing 101
- EZpz Rev
- Authentication
- KeygenMe

---

💡 **Tip**: These challenges are great prep for real-world malware analysis and certifications like OSCE or OSEP.
