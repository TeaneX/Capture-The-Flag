## 🔍 Breakdown of HTB Labs Challenges

### 🔹 1. **Categories**

HTB Labs challenges are split into categories based on specific cybersecurity disciplines:

- **Web** – Exploiting websites or web apps (e.g., XSS, SQLi, authentication bypass)  
- **Crypto** – Breaking or analyzing cryptographic systems  
- **Forensics** – Investigating digital artifacts like memory dumps, pcap files, or disk images  
- **Reverse Engineering** – Analyzing compiled binaries to understand or manipulate them  
- **Pwn** – Exploiting binaries (buffer overflows, format strings, etc.)  
- **Misc** – Challenges that don't fit a specific category, often creative or unconventional  
- **Blockchain**, **Mobile**, **Hardware**, and **Cloud** – Specialized niche topics

### 🔹 3. **Points & Ranking**

- Solving challenges earns you points.
- Points contribute to your **HTB Rank** (e.g., Noob → Hacker → Pro Hacker → Elite Hacker).
- Many people treat HTB as a gamified resume for showcasing cybersecurity skills.

---

### 🔹 4. **Format**

- Each challenge usually comes with a downloadable file (e.g., binary, zip, PCAP, image).
- You analyze it locally using your own tools (Kali Linux is commonly used).
- The goal is to find and submit a **flag** in the format: `HTB{example_flag}`

---

### 🔹 5. **Writeups & Learning**

- After solving or retiring a challenge, you can view or submit writeups.
- Writeups are a great way to learn from others and review new techniques, tools, or tricks.
- It’s highly recommended to document your process (e.g., in Obsidian)!
