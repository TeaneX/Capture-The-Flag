# 🛡️ Cybersecurity: Protecting the Digital World

## 🔍 What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or theft. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard information and ensure the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** (CIA Triad) of digital assets.

## 🎯 Goals of Cybersecurity

1. **Confidentiality** – Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    
2. **Integrity** – Ensure that information remains accurate and unaltered.
    
3. **Availability** – Guarantee reliable access to information and systems when needed.

## ⚠️ Common Cyber Threats

- **Phishing** – Deceptive emails or websites trick users into revealing sensitive info.
    
- **Malware** – Includes viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.
    
- **DDoS Attacks** – Overwhelm systems with traffic, making services unavailable.
    
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** – Intercept and alter communication between two parties.
    
- **Zero-Day Exploits** – Attackers exploit unknown vulnerabilities.
    
- **SQL Injection** – Malicious SQL queries to manipulate databases.
    
- **Credential Stuffing** – Use of stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access.
